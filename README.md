# Code Kata Munge
This is my worked example from the 1st meeting of the Edinburgh Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with them. You can run the code with:

    python test-temperature-spread.py

for the weather kata or:

    python test-football-spread.py

for the football kata.

The source of the kata is Dave Thomas of the Pragmatic Programmers and you can find the original write up from 2007 [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging/). You can find out more about the Edinburgh and London Code Dojos at their home-pages  [Edinburgh](http://www.meetup.com/Edinburgh-Code-Dojo/) and [London](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/)

Some older versions can be found in the [coffee](/coffee) folder.
