Code Dojo 3
===========
This is my worked examples from the 3rd meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with them. You can run the code (assuming you have node and coffeescript installed) with:
    coffee temp-spread
for the weather kata or:
    coffee goals-spread
for the football kata. You can run the tests with:
    vows --spec test/*

The source of the kata is the Pragmatic Programmers and you can find the original write up [here](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_four_data_.html). You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
