# Code Dojo 3
This is my worked examples from the 3rd meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with them. You can run the code (assuming you have node and coffeescript installed) with:

> ./run-temperature-spread.sh

for the weather kata or:

> ./run-football-spread.sh

for the football kata. Both of these run the tests first.

After reviewing many Java examples I ended up recoding the temperature spread part in an OO fashion (in the OO folder) in order to play around with how to represent a weather record and a data provider. This can be run with:

> ./run-OO-temp-spread.sh

The source of the kata is the Pragmatic Programmers and you can find the original write up from 2007 [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging/). You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
